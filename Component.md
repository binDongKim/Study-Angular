# Component

- In Angular, *ComponentFactory* creates Component.
- Angular makes a factory for each component if either it's found/used in template or it's declared in `entryComponents` field in a module.
- Once a factory is created, it creates the component based on the information that you provied within the component decorator(`@Component`).
